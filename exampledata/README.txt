Readme

The data files are named as dataset-U(#users)-I(#Items).txt
The predicted values are in files named as predicted-U(#users)-I(#Items).txt (note that there may be negative values due to the correlation coefficient)
The script data-generating-script.py was used to generate these files. You can change the values of variables u and n and generate different sized data and prediction files as needed

NOTE: Your results may not match the predictions exactly due to use of different APIs etc. which is fine. This is just to give you an idea of the type of results we can expect given the data files.
